This is my attempt at writing a NES emulator, I started this project to deepen my knowledge about emulators and some low level tricks, 
I chose Golang to get better at writing code in this language, learning specific things and revise things to fix it on my mind.

this is not a serious emulation, at it's current state is just for **educational purposes**, the code is not optimal and can be improved in various ways.

the skeleton of this project is inspired by [Javidx9](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder) implementation of [NES](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES).

keep in mind that this program is not a copy, some parts of it are indeed equal but some adaptations were made,
while i'm learning I'll take inspiration of Javidx9 and some others implementations of NES, but in the future the plan is to keep improving this code on my own
